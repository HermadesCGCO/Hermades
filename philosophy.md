This website and every single project I work in is and will be free software
(free as in freedom).

## What is Free Software?

Free Software is the software that respects the users' privacy and freedom, in
order to a program to be free it must grant the following freedoms:

* Freedom 0: The freedom to run the program as you want, for any purpose.
* Freedom 1: The freedom to study and modify the way the program works.
* Freedom 2: The freedom to help your neighbour, that's to say, the freedom to
redistribute exact copies of the program.
* Freedom 3: The freedom to help your community, that is to say, the freedom to
create and distribute modified copies of the program.

## Why free software?

Because that's the only way you have to control over your computing, when you
don't have the control, something or someone else has it. Giving another person
or entity the control over your computing, your privacy and your freedom is
unjust, unethical and dangerous.

I will fight as much as I can to help people recover the control.

## Why you should use ONLY free software?

When a program is not free, it is privative software; that is, they take away
users' freedom keeping them divided and helpless.

Divided because they are forbidden from sharing the program, and helpless
because the users don't have the source of the program. That is, they cannot
change it, they cannot find out whast the program is really doing, and it
can do very bad things.
