Hello, I am hermades!

# About

Hi! This is my personal page. Here you can find things that I consider
interesting, there is a personal blog, you can find my projects and the
philosophy of this website, my products and... Basically my lifestyle.

## Why?

I created this site because I want to spread the word of free software and also
try to share my knowledge, that's why I created a completely free virtual school
where you can learn a lot of hacking/programming and operating systems, I hope
you like these things.
