title: Some of my favourites
layout: page

As I mentioned [here](/about) I have no favourite this or that, I don't
have a best something (best friend, for example) or most something (most
horrifying movie, for example), my likes don't work that way, but there are a
few exceptions and those are the following:

**Note**: Take in account that I will only be talking in a personal way.

* **The most beautiful song**: Unchained Melody - The Righteous Brothers
* **The most beautiful voice**:
  - Frank Sinatra
  - Ella Fitzgerald
  - Bing Crosby
* **The funniest person**:
  - Dean Martin
  - Jerry Lewis
  - Jim Carrey
