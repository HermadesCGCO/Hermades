    Now I am translating this entire site to Jekyll, I mean... It doesn't have
    why to be made in PHP, if I need to use PHP in some of my other projects I
    will use PHP just for that project.

    I feel like today I've been quite productive, I have worked a lot on Learning
    (I just added like 5 new exclusive lessons) and I have added quite a few things
    here too.

    I have also changed the date format of this blog and the way the posts are
    displayed.
